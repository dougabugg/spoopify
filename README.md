# spoopify
 An open source clone of the popular music app "spotify".

# Current Status
 Once again, a project that lives in Doug's mind; here's the plan: make a music app for Web, Android and Desktop that can sync media and playback between multiple devices. It will play music from a local/private library, and will support streaming from a server application.
 
## TODO
Currently, I do want to use SQL for the backend, because there might be 10k+ music tracks in some libraries. Since I'm going to use SQL, instead of "hand coding" SQL statements, I want to finish up [libdorkmtk](https://github.com/dougabugg/dougs-object-relationship-modeler-toolkit/) and have that handle all SQL stuff, since I hate looking at SQL.
